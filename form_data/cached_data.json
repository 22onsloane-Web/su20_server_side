Unlike generic courses, our model is replicable and highly scalable, delivering quality tech training to new communities and connecting companies to diverse, qualified talent with a high retention rate.": "Shipsider is founded by a female Ship's Captain, who is the first Port Captain in Türkiye, Capt. Ayse Asli Basak, her journey started in Singapore from global maritime's first venture studio Studio 30 50 on maritime operations artificial intelligence idea. She's a graduate from Istanbul Technical University Maritime Transport Engineering and served for Turkish merchant navy across oceans more than 6 years. Then worked as a Port Captain in European ports more than 7 years. Capt. Ayse is already a successfull leader in maritime and got award Top 10 Women to Watch in Global Shipping in 2019. With her total experience in ship operations more than 17 years, she generated a modular, AI-driven †œsuper-app† that digitises the full chain of maritime commercial operations, pre/post-fixture, laytime & demurrage, charter party and adds CarbonGo, a real-time EU ETS ship carbon-tax/emissions calculator, in one platform for the first time in the industry built by ship operators for ship operators. Unlike point tools, we integrate own generated AI saving algorithm for carbon saving, freight cost saving and laytime/demurrage saving; our proprietary saving methodology and carbon management for ships into a single workflow, enabling faster decisions, fewer errors and measurable financial and environmental gains for maritime companies which carries more than 90% of global trade.\r\nAI across the voyage; domain-specific models for pre/post-fixture optimisation, laytime automation and Charter Party management reduce manual calculations and port-stay penalties; CarbonGo performs real-time voyage-level carbon pricing and compliance math for EU ETS, tracking for EU Allowances for ships fleets. This cross-module orchestration is what lets operators act on one truth instead of five or six disconnected systems. TRL-proven stack; Pre-Fixture and Post-Fixture modules are TRL-9 (in-market); Laytime AI and CP Management are TRL-8 (AI training in beta); CarbonGo launched July 2024 (app store), and new Carbon Management Platform for Container Ship Fleets, coming soon with a TRL 6 Proof of Concept with Qatar's biggest maritime company of 12 ships and integrated into marine chart mapping, tracking for ships fleets, containerized cargo, per voyage, per container for real time carbon emissions. Performance deltas (KPIs); up to 88% time efficiency, 50% less freight revenue loss with own saving methodology which is replacing the current platforms in shipping and up to 40% lower carbon-tax exposure by carbon saving algorithm versus manual/legacy workflows. \r\nShipsider is breakthrough, because competitors offer fragments (single-purpose calculators, spreadsheets, or generic ERPs). While big enterprises invest on maintaining the technological solutions, small and medium sized of maritime companies and small ship fleets struggle on managing all tasks for ship operation and maritime decarbonization. Shipsider is per our customers and materials, the only comprehensive AI-driven SaaS covering the end-to-end shipping commercial flow and carbon pricing in one UX, which both compresses cycle-time and elevates decision quality, focused on saving with own-generated model integration. This pushes industry practice beyond human-intensive reconciliation toward continuous, model-assisted operations and compliance-by-design. Market traction & demonstrable results:\r\n-Adoption: 25 B2B maritime companies engaged and 250 active users across 8 countries; named customers include Milaha (Qatar), Borusan Logistics, Pegasus Shipping, among others. \r\n-Enterprise validation: live pilot/POC integrating CarbonGo via API for Milaha's container fleet (Qatar). \r\n\r\n-Commercial readiness: 5+ paid POCs/sales and 25+ pre-sales agreements; CarbonGo TRL-9 in market. 600K USD Proof of Concept B2E enterprise customer for maritime decarbonization for container fleet in Qatar, as agreed, not revenued yet.\r\n\r\n-Scale & value-chain impact: We target the $760B dry cargo segment, serving small-to-mid operators historically priced-out of advanced digital and carbon tools; there are 30,000+ maritime companies and 1.8M annual port calls (each a laytime event) as per UNCTAD report and World Bank. Our plan is to reach 1,000 companies with a scalable B2B subscription model. This creates a new, carbon-aware operations layer that links ship brokers, ship owners and ship operators in one data spine for maritime operations and decarbonization.\r\n-IP & defensibility: We protect brand/code and deepen moat through applied research: registered trademark, copyright registration for Shipsider & CarbonGo algorithm codes in Türkiye and an R&D application with TÜBÄ°TAK for CarbonGo's ship-emissions technology. \r\nExternal validation: Winner of UNIDO Global Climate Impact Program Türkiye (overall 1st between 20 countries) for climate impact (CarbonGo); 1st Winner of Qatar's Ministry of Information Technology Digital Incubation (Growth Track); NVIDIA Inception incubated startup; Top-5 Women Entrepreneurs in Türkiye as †œPromising Woman in Technology† category. These validate novelty, scalability and the platform's climate impact, as a female Captain founded startup by combining SDG goals 5, 9, 13, 14.  As a female founded technology firm, Shipsider became Winner at UN Women Entrepreneurship Programme and won the Best Startup Award in Estonia'24 (between 12 countries).\r\nFrom TRL-9 modules to real-time carbon pricing inside the commercial workflow, Shipsider replaces fragmented, error-prone processes with an AI-native operating layer. The result is a step-change in speed, accuracy  and decarbonisation for a sector that moves 90% of world trade, turning front-line maritime expertise into a defensible, scalable deep-tech product with measurable KPIs and clear market pull.\r\n\r\nShipping moves >90% of world trade, yet core ship†operations are still manual and carbon-intensive by new maritime carbon EU ETS regulations came into force. Shipsider equips ship operators, ship charterers and ship owners with own generated-trained AI that automates commercial workflows and prices EU ETS carbon in real time, so even small and medium size of maritime companies can comply, compete and decarbonise their operations. Environmental impact (measurable):\r\n-5,000 tCOâ‚‚e avoided (UNIDO-validated impact assessment), equal to 9,716 barrels of oil unburned. \r\n-176 tCOâ‚‚ abated to date through voyage/port optimisation; 53 voyages optimised across Europe & Asia; 11 tCOâ‚‚ avoided on one dry-bulk itinerary. \r\n-Qatar's biggest ship fleet on their container ships applying CarbonGo to reduce customers' sea-freight footprints via API integration. \r\nSocio-economic impact (measurable):\r\n-Productivity & profit: Up to 88% faster workflows; â‰¤50% reduction in freight revenue leakage; â‰¤40% lower carbon-tax exposure, by replacing 4†“5 siloed tools \r\n-Adoption & beneficiaries: 250 users across 8 countries, with named customers including Milaha (Qatar), Borusan Logistics and Pegasus Shipping; scalable to 800 direct and ~1,000 indirect beneficiaries in the wider ecosystem (operators, port managements, container fleet managers). \r\n-Jobs & inclusion: We've created 7 jobs so far and built a more than 50% women team across three regions. \r\nGender equality & community leadership: Founded by Capt. AyÅŸe AslÄ± BaÅŸak, Shipsider is the first maritime technology startup founded by a female Ship Captain globally, embedding gender equity and social responsibility from day one. A share of profits supports women seafarers and youth digital upskilling (SDG 5). Capt. AyÅŸe co-founded SheFarers (Türkiye's first mentorship platform for female seafarers) in 2019 and actively mentors women entering maritime; she also lectures at Saudi Arabia National Maritime Academy, Istanbul Technical University and speaks at Çanakkale University, expanding STEM skills in a male-dominated field to empower more young women. She is a member of CILT Türkiye (Audit Committee) and WiLAT Türkiye, advancing women's leadership in logistics. Our SDG goals, as a female captain founded startup which is the first one in global maritime industry focused to innovate the global maritime industry with industry knowledge and on board field experience. Gender equality in shipping matters, as Capt. Ayse has been an advocate for women empowerment in shipping over 15 years, also a winner of empowering women seafarers esteblished SheFarers platform, mentored more than 120 female maritime students, impacting this with an establishment motto of Shipsider as a social responsibility for empowering women and young generation since day one. Shipsider is member of CILT Türkiye and Wilat Türkiye and globally attending empowering women in maritime and logistics space with Capt. Ayse's leadership. Capt. Ayse also member of WISTA UK (Women's International Shipping and Trading Association) and helds a role for especially for women seafarers empowering for on board positions, created and circulated anti-harassment guidelines which was circulated at UK ports and ships called UK ports.\r\nAs Shipsider we have UNIDO-approved climate impact & five-year outlook. As UNIDO GCIP (1st Prize) Winner, our climate impact and pathway are externally validated. Over the next five years, we project large-scale abatement by deploying CarbonGo and our operational ship carbon saving methodology across bulk and container fleets, with small and medium sized of maritime companies in emerging markets as first beneficiaries, so climate action in shipping leaves no one behind. SDG alignment (built-in).\r\n-SDG 9: Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure: Digitising a traditionally operated sector (ship operations) with vertical AI for global scale. \r\n-SDG 13: Climate Action: Verified COâ‚‚ abatement today; transparent carbon pricing, carbon ship tracking to drive greener voyage choices. \r\n-SDG 5: Gender Equality: World's first Female-Captain-founded startup, maritime technology company; profit-sharing to empower women at sea; structured mentoring and leadership via CILT/WiLAT, WISTA UK networks. \r\n-SDG 14: Life Below Water (our contribution via voyage optimisation). Less time at anchor; Shipsider guided planning avoids unnecessary port waiting, cutting near-shore emissions and operational disturbances during anchorage. Cleaner routes; Optimised port sequences and itineraries reduce fuel burn on legs and at berth, lowering pollution pressures on coastal waters.  Catalysing cleaner choices; Visibility of carbon cost has already shifted operators toward lower-carbon fuels on select voyages. We explicitly align with SDG 14 †œLife Below Water† by protecting seas through reduced ship emissions. By committing themselves as Shipsider team that to innovate an industry which is still traditionally operated by SDG 9, focused on maritime industry's especially ship operations transformation globally. As a UNIDO approved impact startup as the Winner of Global Climate Impact Program, Shipsider has a huge impact in 5 years on maritime sector's decarbonization with her knowledge, technology, saving methods, on different cargo ships like bulk carriers, container ships and coaster size of vessels. They totally comitted themselves for the sustainable operations in the maritime industry and producing the value as per these goals.

This dual approach ensures that CareerKit is not just a product but a complete pathway from discovery to career readiness, designed to be engaging, scalable, and deeply relevant to the African context.\r\n\r\nThis physical-first approach is seamlessly connected to the CareerKit Platform, which uses AI and machine learning to match learners' psychometric results and skills with in-demand careers based on their location.

Unlike generic courses, our model is replicable and highly scalable, delivering quality tech training to new communities and connecting companies to diverse, qualified talent with a high retention rate.": "My journey began in 2014, when I was stuck in traffic on a four-kilometre commute that took over 30 minutes. Out of frustration, I borrowed a friend's cycle and reached in 11 minutes. That simple act changed my life. My colleagues began cycling too, and soon I was leading initiatives across my city. I saw firsthand how cycling and walking could transform health, cut congestion, and reduce emissions.\r\n\r\nBut here's the challenge: people know being active is good, yet most give up. Fitness apps track steps, but they don't build motivation. That's why I created Crooze, a gamified fitness and mobility platform that makes activity fun, social, and rewarding.\r\n\r\nOn Crooze, every ride, run, or walk becomes a challenge. Users earn points, compete in leagues, and unlock rewards. And with every trip, Crooze shows the carbon saved, so people see their personal climate impact in real-time.\r\n\r\nToday, over 35,000 users across 700 Indian cities are part of this movement. A student who runs with her friends to top the leaderboard. An office team that reduces stress through wellness challenges. A parent who cycles to set an example for their kids.\r\n\r\nCrooze is now evolving into a SaaS platform for workplace wellness, helping companies reduce burnout, improve health, and build engaged, productive teams.\r\n\r\nOur impact connects directly to three UN SDGs: Good Health, Sustainable Cities, and Climate Action. Our vision is simple yet bold: an India where fitness is fun, cities breathe easier, and every step forward makes the world better.\r\n\r\nCrooze is not just an app, it's a movement for healthier people, greener cities, and a stronger planet.",

Every time a user claims a discount at a local cycle shop, gym, or wellness brand, Crooze drives income for small businesses and the people who run them. With our corporate wellness programs, we see new roles emerging like trainers, wellness coordinators, and engagement managers, all focused on keeping teams healthier and happier.\r\n\r\nIn the long run, we imagine Crooze ambassadors, especially youth and women, leading cycling clubs and mobility drives in their own cities, turning passion into livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor us, job creation is not an afterthought; it's part of the movement.",

Our methodology reduces cultural barriers, increases inclusion, and promotes diversity in a market still concentrated among privileged profiles.": "At the heart of Crooze lies a simple question: why are so many of us unhealthy, stressed, and stuck in traffic, when the solution, moving more and driving less is right in front of us?\r\n\r\nIndia is facing three intertwined social challenges. First, lifestyle diseases like diabetes and heart problems are rising sharply, affecting even young people. Second, our cities are drowning in pollution and congestion, stealing clean air and safe spaces from children and families. Third, we are struggling with community disconnect when people live in the same neighbourhoods but rarely share healthy, positive experiences together.\r\n\r\nCrooze addresses these challenges by making movement joyful. A walk with colleagues becomes a friendly competition. Cycling to the market turns into a carbon-saving win. Families cheer each other on in fitness leagues. In this way, Crooze improves health, reduces pollution, and rebuilds community bonds.\r\n\r\nWe believe small, daily choices can tackle big social problems with one step, one ride, one challenge at a time.",

We design challenges that encourage friends, families, offices, and entire neighbourhoods to get involved. From heritage rides that reconnect citizens to their city, to Crooze Indian Pedalling leagues that build teamwork,the spirit of Crooze is collective.\r\n\r\n  One of my favourite moments was during our Gift a Cycle campaign. We collected unused bicycles from citizens, repaired them, and gifted them to over 100 school girls. Watching those girls ride to school with pride showed how something as simple as a cycle can open doors to education, confidence, and freedom.  \r\n\r\n\r\nOur users don't just track activity; they share stories, celebrate milestones, and cheer each other on. In doing so, they create a culture where movement is normal, where health is shared, and where every pedal or step becomes a community victory.",

When I first started cycling in my city, the roads weren't safe, the culture didn't support it, and many thought it was impractical. But I kept going, first convincing colleagues, then entire communities, and later being appointed as India's first Bicycle Mayor by BYCS, Netherlands.\n\nThat moment was both recognition and responsibility. I knew I had to prove that cycling could be more than a personal choice, it could be a city movement. I launched initiatives like Car-Free September, where we piloted an app rewarding users with carbon credits for cycling, and created cycle-parking installations shaped like cars to spark conversation. I worked with civic bodies, corporates, and schools to show that cycling could solve health, mobility, and climate challenges.\n\nCrooze grew directly out of this journey. We began by motivating individuals to cycle and walk for health, but soon realized people also wanted connection, recognition, and fun. So we introduced gamified leagues, rewards, and real-time carbon-saving trackers. When the pandemic disrupted outdoor activity, we adapted with indoor challenges. Now, as workplaces seek healthier teams, Crooze is evolving into a SaaS wellness platform.\n\nEach step, whether shifting perceptions, building partnerships, or adapting technology, has reinforced my belief: resilience is about staying rooted in the vision but flexible in the path. From being the first Bicycle Mayor to building Crooze, I've learned that change happens not in leaps but in persistent, adaptive steps forward.",

Unlike generic courses, our model is replicable and highly scalable, delivering quality tech training to new communities and connecting companies to diverse, qualified talent with a high retention rate.": "PrévenirCare is a technology-driven solution that integrates multiple layers of Artificial Intelligence to enhance reasoning, deliverability, and monitoring of preventive medical support centered on lifestyle, within a \r\npatient <-> healthcare professionals <-> patients framework. \r\n\r\nOur solution leverages technology to enhance access to preventive medicine while preserving and improving the quality of human interaction (the expertise of healthcare professionals) with patients. \r\n\r\nOur solution is founded on a modular software architecture that integrates artificial intelligence, dynamic user journey structuring, and data security, with a particular emphasis on execution speed (low latency) and digital sovereignty. Key components:\r\n\r\nLow-latency AI: our natural language processing (NLP) and generation frameworks \r\nAugmented by Recovery (RAG) is implemented locally or on low-latency servers (Paris AWS zone), facilitating near-instantaneous response times (< 300 ms) for classifying user needs and generating tailored preventive recommendations. This approach eliminates reliance on remote or third-party APIs, ensuring security, confidentiality, and efficiency. \r\nSemantic recommendations and needs structuring: each user interaction \r\nis vectorized and compared within a database of embeddings that represent health intentions, prevention protocols, or typical profiles. The utilization of RAG models enables the provision of documented responses while preserving a contextualized history of the patient (excluding medical diagnosis). The storage of structured and semi-structured data relies on a relational PostgreSQL database, which serves as the primary system for traceability, user management, and compliance. \r\nThe prospective application of a NoSQL database, specifically of the MongoDB variety, is under consideration for the adaptable storage of heterogeneous documents, such as evolving questionnaire responses, enriched recommendation segments, and interaction logs. This storage solution would facilitate improved management of intricate JSON formats and dynamic modeling of user journey trees. However, this represents a medium-term optimization strategy that has not yet been implemented at this stage.\r\n\r\nInnovations and patentability potential: Given the current state of the art available in the market, our approach is distinctive and incorporates several differentiating elements that are likely to be eligible for protection under intellectual property rights:\r\n\r\nMethod for delineating prevention requirements from unstructured user inputs through natural language processing and adaptive rule logic; \r\nPersonalized orchestration of preventive programs, featuring automatic selection of \r\npractitioners, content, and tracking formats in accordance with a proprietary decision graph;\r\n\r\nThus, PrévenirCare facilitates:\r\ni. A designated patient can ascertain their personalized prevention needs within minutes through an internally developed questionnaire. \r\nii. Leveraging the structured expertise of health professionals, we provide the patient with the most appropriate practitioner to address their requirements. \r\niii. Subsequently, we facilitate the connection by scheduling a consultation appointment between the patient and the practitioner. \r\niv. During the consultation, we employ multiple layers of AI to generate a preliminary report, which will be reviewed by the practitioner prior to being sent to the patient. \r\nv. The patient data utilized to assess their needs will also inform follow-up and motivational strategies for the patient.\r\n\r\nAside from point iii., the feasibility of which is confirmed by the current state of the art, the remaining points represent new products. To our knowledge, no other product is available on the market, for instance, for mapping in this domain or for personalized orchestration.\r\nHybrid RAG architecture combined with health user workflows, specifically applied to non-drug management (excluding disease diagnosis and drug treatment), ensuring regulatory traceability (GDPR/HDS).",

This democratizes services that were previously accessible only to privileged or highly informed groups.\r\n\r\nPersonalization: AI-driven needs assessment enables tailored guidance adapted to each individual's lifestyle, professional constraints, and health literacy level.\r\n\r\nCollective impact: by partnering with companies, insurers, and local healthcare networks (CPTS), PrévenirCare goes beyond individual interventions to enhance the overall health of professional and community groups.\r\n\r\nEquity and inclusion: the model aims to reduce social health inequalities by making prevention concrete, affordable, and integrated into the daily life of adults aged 25 to 60 †” an age group highly exposed yet often overlooked by public health initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe Societal Value Created :\r\n\r\n- Reduced pressure on the healthcare system by lowering the incidence and severity of chronic diseases.\r\n\r\n- Improved quality of life and productivity for working-age adults, generating tangible economic benefits for companies and society at large.\r\n\r\n- Contribution to public health goals (national prevention strategies, cancer control initiatives, cardiovascular risk reduction).",

Their clinical expertise ensures the scientific rigor, safety, and relevance of all recommendations.\r\n\r\nEngagement of patient-users: the platform places individuals at the center of the prevention process. User feedback and usage data are continuously integrated to refine tools and ensure that prevention strategies truly meet daily needs and constraints.\r\n\r\nDynamic communities: by facilitating interaction between patients and healthcare professionals, PrévenirCare fosters a collaborative ecosystem. These communities encourage the dissemination of best practices, mutual support, and long-term adherence to healthier lifestyles.\r\n\r\nOngoing dialogue with stakeholders: insurers, companies, and local healthcare networks (CPTS) are actively engaged to embed prevention into everyday and workplace environments.

Today, thanks to this perseverance, PrévenirCare is backed by all major economic stakeholders in France †” a strong validation of our model and long-term impact.\r\n\r\nA resilient mission by nature: addressing prevention itself is already a demonstration of resilience. It is widely acknowledged that implementing prevention strategies, both at the individual and population level, is complex and often underestimated. By placing prevention at the core of our mission, PrévenirCare has chosen the harder but more impactful path †” one that requires persistence, innovation, and collaboration. This is likely what has motivated the national and international recognitions we have already received.\r\n\r\nStrategic adaptability: we continuously refine our tools, care pathways, and partnership models to remain aligned with the real needs of individuals, healthcare professionals, and organizations. The integration of AI, the diversification of our support formats, and the modular design of our solutions are tangible examples of this agility.\r\n\r\nUnwavering commitment to our goal: while strategies evolve, our compass remains the same †” to democratize primary prevention and make it a natural, accessible, and integrated part of everyday life.

Environmental Challenges\r\nSaudi Arabia is characterized by vast desert lands, extreme heat, water scarcity, and harsh climatic conditions. These factors make large-scale plantation and sustaining green coverage extremely difficult. Traditional methods often fail to ensure survival rates of trees under such tough circumstances.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these barriers, NetZero.sa has introduced cutting-edge AI technologies that analyze:\r\n\r\nSoil composition and health\r\n\r\nUnderground water availability\r\n\r\nAir speed and microclimate conditions\r\n\r\nThis enables rapid, data-driven decisions about where, how, and what type of trees to plant. Our guiding principle is clear: †œWe cannot force a tree into a broken system.†\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, we developed RMDY, an AI-powered tool designed to understand land and ecosystems, and recommend the most effective surgical interventions for successful, sustainable planting.\r\n\r\n2. Social Challenges\r\nBeyond environmental difficulties, communities and private sector partners often raise important questions:\r\n\r\nWhere exactly are the trees planted?\r\n\r\nWho is taking care of them?\r\n\r\nHow many have survived?\r\n\r\nWho is monitoring and counting them?\r\n\r\nThese questions highlight the lack of transparency in traditional plantation models.\r\n\r\n3. NetZero.sa's Transparency Solutions\r\nAfter years of research, we addressed these social challenges by introducing Tree Map and Tree Wallet:\r\n\r\nTree Map brings full transparency by showing every tree in its exact location, along with data on its health, species, and carbon storage.\r\n\r\nTree Wallet connects individuals and communities to their trees, giving them ownership and visibility into their impact.\r\n\r\nTogether, these technologies bring accuracy, accountability, and transparency to nature-based solutions, while also fostering a personal relationship between people and their trees.",
      "We develop partnerships with schools, NGOs, companies, and local leaders to offer free courses, mentorship, and events. We empower youth with technical and socio-emotional skills, strengthening community networks and creating opportunities for social transformation that originate directly from their own territory.": "Youth Empowerment & Awareness\r\n\r\nAt NetZero.sa, we place youth at the center of our mission. Our technologies and innovations have inspired many young people across Saudi Arabia†”from local universities to nationwide initiatives†”to actively engage in climate action and environmental sustainability.\r\n\r\n1. Empowering Youth through Technology\r\nBy introducing tools like Tree Log and Tree Wallet, we enable university students and young professionals to directly participate in tree planting, monitoring, and sustainability projects. These technologies give youth hands-on experience in applying digital solutions to environmental challenges.\r\n\r\n2. Building Awareness & Engagement\r\nNetZero.sa goes beyond internal capacity building. We actively:\r\n\r\nHost and participate in national and international conferences to raise awareness on climate solutions.\r\n\r\nConduct awareness activities in universities, encouraging students to take part in plantation programs.\r\n\r\nEncourage youth participation in national sustainability competitions, aligning with the goals of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030.\r\n\r\n3. Youth-Driven Team\r\nOur commitment is reflected in our own workforce†”the entire NetZero.sa team consists of young professionals, all graduates from local universities. This ensures that our solutions are not only innovative but also deeply rooted in the aspirations of Saudi Arabia's next generation of leaders.",

For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, NetZero successfully sustained operations through a lean approach, proving the resilience of our strategy.\r\n\r\n1. Global Scalability\r\nOur solutions are tailored not only to the Saudi environment but also adaptable to regional and international markets. Today, NetZero is already operating in:\r\n\r\nBahrain, Egypt, Indonesia, Morocco, and Brazil\r\n\r\nWith expansion into Malaysia planned for the end of this quarter\r\n\r\nThis global presence demonstrates our ability to scale and operate across diverse ecosystems.\r\n\r\n2. Diversified Partnerships\r\nNetZero's revenue model is not solely dependent on the private sector. We are now working directly with government ministries as well as private organizations, creating a strong dual market base.\r\n\r\n3. Expanding Incentives Across Sectors\r\nWe actively design incentives for non†“oil and gas sectors, including:\r\n\r\nTourism\r\n\r\nHealthcare\r\n\r\nTransportation\r\n\r\nManufacturing\r\n\r\nAnd other industries\r\n\r\nThis approach encourages these sectors to participate in tree planting and contribute to both the Saudi Green Initiative and the Middle East Green Initiative.\r\n\r\n4. Multiple Revenue Streams\r\nBy combining government partnerships, private sector engagement, and international operations, NetZero.sa ensures multiple sustainable revenue streams across regions and industries.",

From planting micro forests in urban areas improving air quality and increasing bioversity, to engaging children in hospitals and farmers in Brazil, we have shown that environmental solutions can change human behavior and contribute towards climate action. To date, we have planted over 1.5 smart million trees, covering 1,350 hectares, removing 14.2 million kg of COâ‚‚ and 964,900 kg of air pollutants, while forging partnerships with 60+ governments and private entities both in Saudi Arabia and globally. Yet our true achievement lies in how we connect restoration with people's daily lives. In Madinah, trees planted along hospitals and pilgrimage routes now shade millions of visitors, protecting them from extreme heat during their visit to the Holy Sites. In a pediatric dialysis unit, young patients planted trees themselves, finding healing and purpose in nature. Along coastlines, our mangrove projects restore fisheries, sequester higher amounts of carbon, improve water quality, and build resilience for vulnerable communities. We have demonstrated resilience and adaptability by operating across Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt, and Brazil, tailoring solutions to vastly different ecosystems and cultural contexts. From using greywater irrigation in our projects, to restoring nature reserves, we have turned challenges into opportunities for innovation. Inclusivity drives our work, we empower the youth in green",

Biomass is mostly made up of plants which make use of the light from the sun to create energy through photosynthesis many of the developing countries produce huge quantities of agricultural  residues but they are used inefficiently causing extensive pollution to the environment. The major residues are rice husk, coffee husk, coir pith, jute sticks, bagasse, groundnut shells, mustard stalks and cotton stalks. Sawdust, a milling residue is also available in huge quantity. \r\n\r\nBy briquetting waste materials, volumes can be reduced by up to 90%. This creates a significant savings on transportation/handling/storage costs for later use as a heat source or simply for more convenient disposal. An additional advantage comes from briquetting flammable waste materials such as fine dust particles that are often created from wood processing operations. Briquetting eliminates the dust from the air and the mess created when removing dust collection bags, further reducing the risk of sparks or fire. \r\n\r\nBriquettes are immeasurably cleaner than the other fuel alternatives - especially coal! Therefore, government incentives that support briquetting systems and production along with dis-incentives for coal use make briquetting solutions extremely attractive. Plus, they don't create dust, and  briquettes burn in a controlled manner, slow and efficiently. They burn well in boilers and burners. More and more, utility companies are using biomass briquettes to supplement or replace coal as a solid fuel source.",

In addition to developing talent for the market, we generate direct opportunities for our students, fostering an ecosystem of work and innovation in the regions we serve.": "By enabling small commercial vehicles, we are bringing down the upfront cost to get a refrigerated vehicle. We are promoting the use of cold chain in mid-mile delivery segment. With the growth of quick commerce in India and increased organization in retail, the demand for cold chain is increased on the other hand, the existing players are not equipped with the right tools to cater to this demand. We are reducing the economical and technological barrier to enter this segment which indirectly results in more profit creation and more business development.",

Our methodology reduces cultural barriers, increases inclusion, and promotes diversity in a market still concentrated among privileged profiles.": "As a clean tech start-up, we have social & Environmental impact as our focus. \r\nWith existing solutions, small commercial vehicles and EV 3W/4W are not able to get refrigerated. Hence, perishable producers have no option but to pay high costs for cold chain vehicles. Now, many small scale producers and retailers can not afford this cost, and tend to use cheap alternatives like Dry Ice and Insulated boxes which further limits them to expand their business and ensure the quality of food. With our solution, we are enabling Micro-entrepreneurs to get into cold chain by reducing the required investment to have a cold chain vehicle as well as by making it accessible to SCVs and EVs which is further reducing the overall transportation cost by 25-30%. Our solution is bridging the gap by enabling the unserved small scale perishable producer to increase their profits and business by making cold chain transportation accessible and affordable to them.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the smallest available active refrigerated vehicle in the market is Bolero/Dost (8ft size). The existing Carrier/Thermoking systems attached with such vehicles have an average consumption of 3-4L of fuel per day. In some cases like Bangalore in peak traffic time, it goes up to 5L a day! If we talk about bigger vehicles (20-40ft) where such AC systems are operated with a separate diesel engine which keeps on running for days sometimes, the fuel consumption of such AC systems is 3-4L per hour! \r\n\r\nIn terms of savings, we are saving the fuel by switching from fossil fuel driven AC systems to our Electric AC system. Annually, our AC system is capable of saving ~930 L of fuel. Additionally, by enabling SCVs and EVs, which are further fuel efficient and 0 emission vehicles respectively, overall we help save ~2000 L to ~4000 L of fuels respectively with CV and EV refrigerated vehicles (savings combined of vehicle+AC). That is equivalent to saving ~5 tons and ~11 tons of CO2 per vehicle per year. And this impact is just with our smaller product, if we are to extrapolate the CO2 reduction capabilities just with our AC unit, it ranges from 3 to 36 tons per system per year.\r\n\r\nWith our Made in India product, we are eliminating the use of fossil fuel and increasing the cold-chain penetration in India to ensure food security. We are focusing on SDG Indicators 2.3.2, 9.2.1, 9.4.1 and 12.3.1 for our Impact measurement.",
      "We develop partnerships with schools, NGOs, companies, and local leaders to offer free courses, mentorship, and events.

Currently 95% of our components are sourced from India and in next 2 years we are aiming to make it 100%. \r\nOur solution plays critical role in maintaining the cold chain between the Production and Consumer. In Mid-mile, where the cold chain penetration is less, has a higher chance of goods spoilage. The same solution can be replicated to power the mobile Milk Chillers and agricultural produce collection units which will help connect the small and marginal farmers living in inaccessible areas. We are already planning to working on such concepts with the national bodies of India.",

Even when faced with economic or technological restrictions, we adjust classes, curricula, and formats (in-person, hybrid, or online) to maintain access, quality, and social impact.": "With the growth of perishables, the need for cold chain logistics has increased. But Indian Cold chain segment lags behind in terms of infrastructure and sustainable technologies. This is where Yotuh Energy is bringing a change by equipping the logistics players, small business holders and individuals with smart, more efficient and sustainable technologies to make their business climate resilient and to satisfy the need of the industry. Our solution comes with a web-app monitoring tool to remotely monitor the temperatures of the container as well as the location, battery percentage and system health. The temperature reports can be automatically generated which can be shared with the end user. The system adapts as per the operational conditions (Ambient temp., Delivery points etc.) in order to maximize the efficiency and run-times. With vehicle independent structure, the system can be used with any type of vehicle (Diesel, Petrol, CNG or EV). It can even be retro fitted onto the existing vehicles of the transporters.",
